# Deployment

First time built and deployed a MERN app and first time used https://render.com/.

I actually cloned and copied this repo of mine and packed everything outside backend and frontend into the backend folder for they all belonged in there. And tweaked a lil bit the scripts in package.json just to make them work again.
After several hours of struggle Render had finally managed to deploy my BE, also found out that I need to install cors and use it in order to make sure my FE can communicate with the API's.

But it works and available here: https://helpdesk-mern.onrender.com/
